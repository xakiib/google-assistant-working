To integrate Google Assistant with your API, you can follow these general steps:

1. Create a Dialogflow agent: Start by creating a Dialogflow agent, which is a conversational interface for your Google Assistant application. You can set up intents, entities, and fulfillment in Dialogflow to handle user requests and responses.

2. Configure fulfillment: In Dialogflow, enable fulfillment and specify the webhook URL for your API. This webhook URL will receive requests from Dialogflow when user interactions require data from your API.

3. Implement the API endpoint: Set up an endpoint in your Node.js application to handle requests from Dialogflow. This endpoint will receive requests from Dialogflow, process the necessary data from your API, and send the response back to Dialogflow.

4. Handle the request in your API: In your API endpoint code, parse the request parameters from Dialogflow, make the necessary API calls to retrieve or modify data, and prepare the response.

5. Send the response back to Dialogflow: Once you have processed the request and obtained the necessary data from your API, construct a response and send it back to Dialogflow. The response can include text, speech, suggestions, cards, or any other supported format based on your requirements.

6. Fulfill the user's request: In Dialogflow, configure the intent fulfillment to use the response received from your API endpoint. This will enable the Assistant to respond to the user based on the data retrieved from your API.

Keep in mind that the exact implementation details will depend on your specific API and the requirements of your Google Assistant application. Dialogflow provides various features and options to handle complex conversations, including context management, slot filling, and webhook responses.

You can refer to the Dialogflow documentation and the Google Assistant platform documentation for more detailed information and examples specific to your use case.
